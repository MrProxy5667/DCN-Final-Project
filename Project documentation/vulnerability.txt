basic problems:
Sometimes hosts will not be fully obtained by FloodLight; in this situation, the paths can only be determined for the already-in hosts;
This could cause pingall to fail for some hosts that have not been added;

implementation of part 3:
1. When network topology is incomplete, sometimes a host may have null as its connected switch, causing unexpected exceptions.
   This may be result from orphan nodes that the switch it connect to is down;
2. Time efficiency; Every time network topology changes, the entire adjacency table is regenerated and shortest paths are all recomputed;
   Maybe some method can be used to improve this, and to improve the time efficiency, e.g., using more efficient algorithm.

impl of 4:
1. Sometimes the rules added for TCP SYN will cause null exception;
   The reason of this is still not figured out, maybe this is another FloodLight error, since it is not always there.
